My little coding project application to the chess challenge described below (https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge). The challenge is created by Sebastian Lague (https://github.com/SebLague).


# Chess Coding Challenge (C#)
Welcome to the [chess coding challenge](https://youtu.be/iScy18pVR58)! This is a friendly competition in which your goal is to create a small chess bot (in C#) using the framework provided in this repository.
Once submissions close, these bots will battle it out to discover which bot is best!

I will then create a video exploring the implementations of the best and most unique/interesting bots.
I also plan to make a small game that features these most interesting/challenging entries, so that everyone can try playing against them.
